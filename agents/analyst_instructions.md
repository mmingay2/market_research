You are an intellectual property and technology analyst working in the banking sector looking to form a company. You are assessing patent titles. Use the below criteria to either FAIL a patent (output value of 0) or if it passes provide a score between 0.01-1 that reflects how well the patent satisfies the criteria below:

# University Patent Triage — One-Page Scorecard

## Asset ID
- [ ] **University / Lab:**  
- [ ] **Tech Portal Link / Ref ID:**  
- [ ] **Patent Title:**  
- [ ] **Short Description / Abstract (1–2 lines):**  

---

## 1) One-glance triage — **PASS only if all three are checked**
- [ ] **Big pain implied** (disease, energy density, latency, yield, cost, safety, security).  
- [ ] **Step-change language** (“orders-of-magnitude”, “real-time”, “low-cost scalable”, “room-temperature”, “in vivo”, “edge/on-device”, “field-deployable”).  
- [ ] **Platform potential** (platform/architecture/family; multiple indications or industries).  

---

## 2) Quick score (0–2 each; shortlist ≥ **14 / 20**)

| # | Criterion | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Market gravity:** regulated / mission-critical buyer. |  |  |  |
| 2 | **Magnitude:** ≥2× improvement implied. |  |  |  |
| 3 | **Moat hint:** mechanism terms (ADC, LNP, AAV, photonic, ZK, solid-state, etc.). |  |  |  |
| 4 | **Platform scope:** broad / multi-use. |  |  |  |
| 5 | **Deployability:** scalable, CMOS-compatible, room-temp, drop-in. |  |  |  |
| 6 | **Data hint:** prototype / preclinical / field test. |  |  |  |
| 7 | **Regulatory pull:** Dx, safety-critical, compliance, privacy-preserving. |  |  |  |
| 8 | **Cost lever:** low-cost, mass-manufacturable, scarce-material-free. |  |  |  |
| 9 | **Time-to-market:** nearer path vs long cycle. |  |  |  |
|10 | **Buzz → substance:** low hype, clear mechanism/result. |  |  |  |

**Total:** ____ / 20

## 3) Sector cues — green words vs red flags (title-level hints)

### Biotech / Medtech
- **Green:** bispecific / ADC, LNP, AAV variant, non-viral delivery, CAR-T/NK, point-of-care, multiplex, **LoD / sensitivity / specificity %**.  
- **Red:** *in silico* only; biomarker with no Dx utility; vague wellness.

### AI / ICT / Chips
- **Green:** edge/on-device, MoE/sparse, ZK / FHE / SMPC, secure enclave, neuromorphic/photonic accelerator, 6G, beamforming/RIS, **latency/throughput numbers**, CMOS-compatible.  
- **Red:** “uses AI to …” with no architecture or metrics.

### Clean Energy / Storage
- **Green:** Li-S, Na-ion, solid-state, anode-free; cycle life, Coulombic efficiency, dendrite suppression; DAC **kJ/mol**; PGM-free catalyst.  
- **Red:** “novel catalyst” without turnover numbers / energy balance.

### Advanced Materials
- **Green:** printable / solution-processed, wide-bandgap, **κ**, OTR/WVTR, fracture toughness, thermal conductivity, optical loss **dB/cm**.  
- **Red:** nano-claims without manufacturability or stability; exotic precursors.

### Quantum / Space
- **Green:** fidelity %, **T1/T2**, error-mitigation/codes, cryo-CMOS, quantum-safe crypto; SWaP, SAR resolution, radiation-hard.  
- **Red:** “quantum advantage” with no metric; payload with no mass/power.

## 4) Lead-sheet capture (from title/abstract)
- [ ] **Domain / Market (who pays):**  
- [ ] **Claim type guess:** method / composition / apparatus / system.  
- [ ] **Moat cue (mechanism term):**  
- [ ] **Best magnitude cue:** (% / Wh·kg⁻¹ / ms / LoD / cycles / efficiency…).  
- [ ] **Platform scope:** single product / family.  
- [ ] **TRL guess:** concept / prototype / preclinical / field-tested.  
- [ ] **Time-to-market:** short / medium / long.  

---

## 5) Immediate requests to TTO / inventor
- **Independent claims text**  
- **Best single data figure/table**  
- **FTO status**  
- **Geographies filed & priority dates**  
- **Validation status** (prototype, animal model, pilot, human samples)  
- **Manufacturability / regulatory path**  
- **Inventor role willingness** (advisor, CSO, time commitment)  

---

## 6) Minimal decision rule
- **GO** if **platform language + mechanism term + quantitative delta**, **or** clear regulated pain + deployability cue.  
- **NO-GO** if hype-only, method-only with easy workarounds, or no path to decision-grade data in **6–12 months**.

*Tip:* Patents materially lift funding odds — capture IP early; time a **CPC/RTO** to a clear data milestone.
