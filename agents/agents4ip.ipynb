    "1. **Big pain implied** – significant unmet need in health, manufacturing, diagnostics, or bio-process efficiency (e.g., disease burden, yield, toxicity, cold-chain limitations, sensitivity/specificity).\n",
    "2. **Platform potential** – compositional/methodological platform or architecture with multi-target, multi-indication, or multi-pathway applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DETAILED SCORING (0-2 points each, max 20):\n",
    "1. **Market gravity** – presence of a regulated or mission-critical buyer (e.g., hospital, lab, payer, bioprocess operator).\n",
    "2. **Magnitude** – ≥2× improvement implied (e.g., LoD, titer, sensitivity, yield, IC50, KD, AUROC).\n",
    "3. **Moat hint** – mentions of defensible mechanism terms (e.g., ADC, bispecifics, LNP, AAV, directed evolution, engineered CAR, synthetic enzymes).\n",
    "4. **Platform scope** – broad multi-use or modular application (e.g., adaptable vector or multiplex assay).\n",
    "5. **Deployability** – scalable, GMP/CMC friendly, room-temperature stable, drop-in to existing workflows.\n",
    "6. **Data hint** – evidence of a prototype, in vitro data, preclinical model, or functional testing beyond in silico.\n",
    "7. **Regulatory pull** – Dx relevance, safety-critical claims, compliance or privacy-preserving architecture, or known regulatory pathway (e.g., IVD, CLIA, BLA).\n",
    "8. **Cost lever** – low-cost inputs, simple manufacturing, cold-chain independence, fewer unit ops.\n",
    "9. **Time-to-market** – enables pilot data within 6–12 months (Dx preferred), or plausible path for therapeutics.\n",
    "10. **Buzz → substance** – specific mechanism and result over vague hype (\"AI-designed biology\" must have data).\n",

    "# ## SCORING CRITERIA\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### INITIAL TRIAGE (Must pass ALL THREE to proceed):\n",
    "# 1. **Big pain implied** - disease, energy density, latency, yield, cost, safety, security\n",
    "# 2. **Step-change language** - \"orders-of-magnitude\", \"real-time\", \"low-cost scalable\", \"room-temperature\", \"in vivo\", \"edge/on-device\", \"field-deployable\"\n",
    "# 3. **Platform potential** - platform/architecture/family; multiple indications or industries\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### DETAILED SCORING (0-2 points each, max 20):\n",
    "# 1. **Market gravity** - regulated/mission-critical buyer\n",
    "# 2. **Magnitude** - ≥2× improvement implied\n",
    "# 3. **Moat hint** - mechanism terms (ADC, LNP, AAV, photonic, ZK, solid-state, etc.)\n",
    "# 4. **Platform scope** - broad/multi-use\n",
    "# 5. **Deployability** - scalable, CMOS-compatible, room-temp, drop-in\n",
    "# 6. **Data hint** - prototype/preclinical/field test\n",
    "# 7. **Regulatory pull** - Dx, safety-critical, compliance, privacy-preserving\n",
    "# 8. **Cost lever** - low-cost, mass-manufacturable, scarce-material-free\n",
    "# 9. **Time-to-market** - nearer path vs long cycle\n",
    "# 10. **Buzz → substance** - low hype, clear mechanism/result\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### SECTOR-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Biotech/Medtech Green Words:** bispecific/ADC, LNP, AAV variant, non-viral delivery, CAR-T/NK, point-of-care, multiplex, LoD/sensitivity/specificity %\n",
    "# **Biotech/Medtech Red Flags:** in silico only; biomarker with no Dx utility; vague wellness\n",
    "\n",
    "# **AI/ICT/Chips Green Words:** edge/on-device, MoE/sparse, ZK/FHE/SMPC, secure enclave, neuromorphic/photonic accelerator, 6G, beamforming/RIS, latency/throughput numbers, CMOS-compatible\n",
    "# **AI/ICT/Chips Red Flags:** \"uses AI to...\" with no architecture or metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Clean Energy/Storage Green Words:** Li-S, Na-ion, solid-state, anode-free; cycle life, Coulombic efficiency, dendrite suppression; DAC kJ/mol; PGM-free catalyst\n",
    "# **Clean Energy/Storage Red Flags:** \"novel catalyst\" without turnover numbers/energy balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Advanced Materials Green Words:** printable/solution-processed, wide-bandgap, κ, OTR/WVTR, fracture toughness, thermal conductivity, optical loss dB/cm\n",
    "# **Advanced Materials Red Flags:** nano-claims without manufacturability or stability; exotic precursors\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Quantum/Space Green Words:** fidelity %, T1/T2, error-mitigation/codes, cryo-CMOS, quantum-safe crypto; SWaP, SAR resolution, radiation-hard\n",
    "# **Quantum/Space Red Flags:** \"quantum advantage\" with no metric; payload with no mass/power\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## SCORING RULES:\n",
    "# - **FAIL (score = 0)**: If patent doesn't pass initial triage OR is hype-only, method-only with easy workarounds, or no path to decision-grade data\n",
    "# - **PASS (score = 0.01-1)**: Convert criteria score (0-20) to 0.01-1 scale proportionally\n",
    "# - **Decision Rule**: GO if platform language + mechanism term + quantitative delta, OR clear regulated pain + deployability cue\n",

    "#     Abstract: \"A novel edge computing architecture utilizing neuromorphic processors for real-time safety-critical decision making in autonomous vehicles. The system achieves 10x faster response times compared to cloud-based solutions while maintaining 99.9% accuracy in obstacle detection. CMOS-compatible design enables mass manufacturing at low cost.\"\n",
