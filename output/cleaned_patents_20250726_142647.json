    "description": "Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has developed natural, science-based poultry feed additives that combine fruit pomaces and Limosilactobacillus reuteri strains to promote gut health, prevent disease, and support poultry growth—without the use of traditional antibiotics. AAFC is seeking an industry partner with the capacity to commercialize these ingredients within the Canadian agriculture sector and beyond, offering collaborative R&D support and regulatory groundwork already underway including Experimental Study Certificates (ESC) from Health Canada. The products can be manufactured using standard food processing equipment, and drying protocols are established; however, further scale-up and regulatory clearance for probiotic (L. reuteri) use may require up to one year. This technology aligns directly with industry efforts to phase out medically important antibiotics in broiler production and expand sustainable feed options. Interested partners should express interest by August 7, 2025, to explore this opportunity and contribute to transforming poultry health globally."

    "description": "The proposed innovation consists of a cost-efficient extraction method for double stranded RNA (dsRNA) using a combination of buffer solutions and a dsRNA binding protein for viral genome detection, sequencing and characterization. This new method is more efficient and less complex than other available methods. It yields high quality and high quantity of dsRNA for viral-like genome characterization. The growing presence of virus infected plant material in Canada creates the need to have a cost-effective, efficient and rapid method for viral testing. This novel method will allow the Canadian industry to monitor plant (and other) material on a regular basis to ensure that only the cleanest material is used. We are confident that this technology can play a major role in Canadian agriculture by identifying and ultimately preventing the propagation of viruses throughout farms. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is seeking an industry partner who has the knowledge and capacity to commercialize the technology for the Canadian agricultural sector. Please demonstrate your interest by November 11, 2024."

The DA and AFBA content were selected for conjugation into the backbone of the HA polymer for the desired hormone delivery profile. The patch provides high drug loading capacity for long-term drug delivery application. The crosslinking mechanism for microneedle fabrication is biocompatible and beneficial for sustaining hormone drug stability and bioactivity as it does not require harsh crosslinking conditions. Facile pH adjustment of the matrix hydrogel can be easily casted into a microneedle patch without multistep processes that conventional patch polymerization requires. The present matrix microneedle patch demonstrates sufficient skin penetration, rapid swelling in interstitial media, high drug loading capacity and effective hypo/hyperglycemia prevention by the automated hypo/hyperglycemia-triggered delivery of hormones through the skin."

    "description": "An optical system and methods have been developed for real-time synchronous detection of vibration and/or rotation modes in biotic (e.g., fat, glyceride, vitamins, bilirubin, etc.) and abiotic systems (e.g., alcohol contents). The system and methods include a modulated light source (e.g., a CW laser of 1064 nm wavelength modulated at square wave signal at 5600 Hz by a square wave signal), laser beam shaping and light collecting optics, optical detectors, appropriately selected optical filters, mechanical or electronic laser beam modulator, electrical signal amplifiers (e.g., transimpedance, current and voltage amplifiers), synchronous detector (e.g. lock-in amplifier), data acquisition and hardware and software control systems. One or multiple lock-in amplifiers are used to extract weak signals from noisy background. The system has three configurations/embodiments for in-situ and ex-situ end uses - (i) tabletop probe, (ii) handheld probe and (iii) miniature handheld probe. The handheld probe is for ex-situ and open surgery whereas the tabletop probe can be combined with other systems for ex-situ (monitoring) assessments. The miniature handheld probe can be used in conjunction with needle biopsies. The weak signal of characteristic optical scattering (e.g., Raman scattering) peaks of target biotic indicators (e.g., glyceride, vitamins, bilirubin, etc.) and abiotic molecules (e.g., alcohol) are identified using sensitive lock-in amplification technique, which supersedes the state-of-the-art for other similar approaches and allows for the detection of weak Raman signals in ambient light conditions (e.g., LED and luminescent light). Without restricting the generality of the present disclosure, the system has been shown to provide a quantitative result of the fat content quickly and accurately in (i) lipid phantoms and (ii) liver samples, demonstrating a strong linear correlation (e.g., r > 0.98) between output voltage signals and fat contents in the clinically relevant range."

In a wet/underwater environment, the water boundary layer hinders interfacial adhesion, which is further undermined by water-induced swelling in bioadhesives. In contrast to current hydrophilic bioadhesives, we here propose an underwater and in-situ applicable hydrophobic adhesive (UIHA). We report polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tangled with macromolecular silicone fluid as a dissipation phase to provide strong interface adhesion strength. The silicone fluid repels the surface boundary water layer, overcomes capillary break up in water, and rapidly gelates with PDMS, while a small amount of silane (<0.2%) can bridge the hydrophobic adhesive and tissue substrates to an exceptional underwater adhesive strength. UIHA presents in-situ and instant adhesive performances when tested on artery, lung, bone, and skin tissues."

Following that, carbon-additive-free LiCoO2/PPy:CMC cathodes were fabricated by using water as a processing solvent. Carbon-additive-free cathodes were then cycled to study the performance of PPy:CMC electrode matrices. The results indicate that PPy:CMC composites were electrochemically stable within the cathode operating voltage window. As the cycle number increased, electrolyte anions became dopants for PPy units in PPy:CMC composites. The sharp spike in cell voltage of LiCoO2/PPy:CMC cathodes in the first charging cycle indicated that undoped/neutral PPy units in PPy:CMC composite were oxidized and doped to become fully conductive. This unique phenomena teaches an activation procedure for using other CP-based electrode matrices in Li-ion batteries such as polyaniline:carboxymethyl cellulose (PANI:CMC) composites."

    "description": "Visual odometry is the ability to localize with only a camera while moving. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) extends this to also mapping the world simultaneously. The result is a mapping and localization method that produces LIDAR like results with only an inexpensive camera. Direct methods use pixel values while indirect methods use detected visual features. Hybrid methods leverage the advantages of Direct and Indirect Video Odometry. However, hybrid methods in general require complicated systems with a relatively high computational requirements limiting their real-time performance. These methods also cannot perform well in texture-deprived environments, may not provide a consistent performance, and may require a separate process to build and maintain several different map representations. Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a hybrid Visual SLAM method that tightly integrates existing direct and indirect methods to capitalize on each one’s advantages to address the above-mentioned limitations. Waterloo’s Visual SLAM provides direct advantages such as sub-pixel accuracy, inexpensive computational costs, robust under texture deprivation and provides a sparse and semi-dense reconstruction density. Further the method also provides indirect advantages such as being robust to large distances between views, less sensitive to optimization seeds, and robust to lighting changes. These combined advantages provide a global map query capability that supports map re-use. The method provides state-of-the-art low error performance: in visual odometry, this Visual SLAM method outperforms all hybrid, direct & indirect methods’ while in full SLAM after loop closure, the accumulated error is essentially zero. Advantages 1- Robust (to large erratic motions) and reliable (in texture-deprived environment) 2- Generates a global and a local map 3- The Global map is reusable and allows for real-time photometric calibration and loop closure 4- Item 3 results in superior performance in robustness and accuracy 5- Computationally efficient (can run at 50 frames per second on a CPU - no special hardware needed) 6- Agnostic to type of sensor used such as Camera, IMU (i.e. accelerometer), GPS, LIDAR, Radar Potential applications • Autonomous vehicles (including robots, under water vehicles) • AR (Augmented Reality) • UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) • HD maps • Autonomous cars • Surgical"

    "description": "We identified Panx1 as a new binding partner of STIM proteins and demonstrate how ER Ca2+ store depletion induces activation of Panx1 channels in a STIM dependent manner. Using Panx1 deletion variants, we identified the STIM interaction domain within the intracellular N-terminus of Panx1 (amino acids 1-18), which is necessary for promoting Panx1 activation. Further, in hippocampal cultured neurons we show that ionotropic function of NMDARs causes Panx1 activation and knockdown of STIM inhibits Panx1 activation. Panx1-STIM region controls NMDAR-initiated Panx1 activation confirming the model of NMDAR-STIM-Panx1 signalling. N-term (amino acids 19-35) is responsible for plasma membrane trafficking of Panx1 channels. The STIM interaction region of Panx1 is at amino acids 13-18. This region is required to stimulate the pathological activation of Panx1, a response linked to detrimental actions of amyloid beta. This technology provides a target to treat Alzheimer's disease."

    "description": "The COVID-19 disease that is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has exploded into a global pandemic. This is the largest pandemic of the 21st century, with over 50 million cases and 1.2 million fatalities in a time span of approximately only 11 months. Scientists all around the world are racing to develop vaccines and new pharmaceuticals to overcome the pandemic and offer effective treatments for COVID-19 disease. Consequently, there is an essential need to better understand how the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by viral mutations and to determine the conserved segments in the viral genome that can serve as stable targets for novel therapeutics. Here, we introduce a text-mining method to estimate the mutability of genomic segments directly from a reference (ancestral) whole genome sequence. The method relies on calculating the importance of genomic segments based on their spatial distribution and frequency over the whole genome. To validate our approach, we perform a large-scale analysis of the viral mutations in nearly 80,000 publicly-available SARS-CoV-2 predecessor whole genome sequences and show that these results are highly correlated with the segments predicted by the text-mining method. Importantly, these correlations are found to hold at the codon and gene levels, as well as for gene coding regions. Using the text-mining method, we further identify codon sequences that are potential candidates for siRNA-based antiviral drugs. Significantly, one of the candidates identified in this work corresponds to the first seven codons of an epitope of the spike glycoprotein, which is the only SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptide without a match to a human protein."

    "description": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone secreted by L-cells of the gastrointestinal tract in response to incoming glucose. GLP-1 is referred to as an incretin, which serves to potentiate insulin secretion by beta-cells of the pancreas, ensuring that adequate amounts of insulin are released to allow for proper disposal of glucose after consuming a meal. Healthy beta-cells fail to secrete enough insulin when incretin levels do not rise. It is known that GLP-1 levels and action are reduced/impaired in obesity and in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). People with obesity and T2DM often exist in a state of elevated chronic subacute inflammation. To date, only two negative regulators of GLP-1 secretion have been identified (i.e. the hormone somatostatin and the neuropeptide galanin). This invention demonstrates that a compound that is produced in inflammation, called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), can also drastically inhibit GLP-1 secretion by L-cells. LPA is produced directly in atherosclerotic plaques, and it contributes to worsening of cardiovascular disease. It also goes up steadily as people become more and more overweight. Inflammation, obesity, and cardiovascular disease are frequently comorbid with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is considered an inflammatory disease, and there is evidence that inflammation precedes development of T2DM and makes it worse. Waterloo researchers have found that when LPA signaling is blocked using LPA inhibitors, such as LPA-receptor antagonists, the reduction in GLP-1 secretion can be prevented. Therefore LPA-receptor antagonists are expected to beneficially raise GLP-1 as a means of treating T2DM and possibly other diseases associated with low GLP-1 (eg. atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy). Two classes of pharmaceuticals are currently used to improve the efficacy of GLP-1: GLP-1R agonists and dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. GLP-1R agonists have side-effects that include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness and nasopharyngitis. Exenatide, a GLP-1R agonist, may worsen kidney disease. Adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors include GI problems (nausea, diarrhoea, and stomach pain), flu-like symptoms (headache, runny nose, sore throat) and skin reactions. Thus, the use of LPAR antagonists restores the body’s natural mechanism to produce GLP-1 without the side effects associated with GLP-1r agonists and DPP4 inhibitors."

    "description": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by immune mediated neurodegeneration that results in progressive, life-long neurological and cognitive impairments. Yet, the endogenous mechanisms underlying MS pathophysiology are not fully understood. Here, we provide compelling evidence that associates dysregulation of neuregulin-1 beta 1 (Nrg-1β1) with MS pathogenesis and progression. In the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS, we demonstrate that Nrg-1β1 levels are abated within spinal cord lesions and peripherally in the plasma and spleen during pre-symptomatic, onset and progressive course of the disease. We demonstrate that plasma levels of Nrg-1β1 are also significantly reduced in individuals with early MS and is positively associated with progression to relapsing-remitting MS. The functional impact of Nrg-1β1 downregulation preceded disease onset and progression, and its systemic restoration was sufficient to delay EAE symptoms and alleviate disease burden. Intriguingly, Nrg-1β1 therapy exhibited a desirable and extended therapeutic time window of efficacy when administered prophylactically, symptomatically, acutely or chronically. Using in vivo and in vitro assessments, we identified that Nrg-1β1 treatment mediates its beneficial effects in EAE by providing a more balanced immune response. Mechanistically, Nrg-1β1 moderated monocyte infiltration at the blood-central nervous system interface by attenuating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Moreover, Nrg-1β1 fostered a regulatory and reparative phenotype in macrophages, T helper type 1 (Th1) cells and microglia in the spinal cord lesions of EAE mice. Taken together, our new findings in MS and EAE have uncovered a novel regulatory role for Nrg-1β1 early in the disease course and suggest its potential as a specific therapeutic target to ameliorate disease progression and severity."
